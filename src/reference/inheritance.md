# Inheritance and Overriding

Inheritance allows instances of a more concrete class to be treated like
instances of a less concrete class. When you subclass a class, the subclass
inherits all methods and type methods. Initializers are only inherited under
special conditions.

## Initializer Inheritance

In Emojicode, initializers are only inherited by subclasses if the subclass
meets these criteria:

- The subclass does not define any instance variables.
- The subclass does not define any initializer.

If the subclass doesn‚Äôt fullfil these criteria, the subclass doesn‚Äôt inherit
any initializers.

## Required Initializers

Sometimes it‚Äôs desired that all subclasses of a class have a specific
initializer. In this case, a required initializer can be used.

An initializer can be marked as required with the üîë attribute. Subclasses must
implement all initializers marked with üîë themselves if they aren't eligible
for initializer inheritance. These initializer again must then be marked with
üîë, thereby enforcing that all descendants of the original class provide the
required intalizer.

## Overriding Methods

A subclass can override a method defined in a superclass, that is providing
a new implementation of it.

A method is overriden by redeclaring it in the subclass with the ‚úíÔ∏è attribute.
As for example:

```
üêá üåº üçá
  ‚ùóÔ∏è ‚è∞ time üî¢ üçá
    üí≠ Open and close the blossom according to the time...
  üçâ
üçâ

üêá üåª üåº üçá
  ‚úíÔ∏è ‚ùóÔ∏è ‚è∞ time üî¢ üçá
    üí≠ Sunflowers also rotate to face the sun....
 ¬† ¬†‚§¥Ô∏è‚è∞ time  üí≠ Open and close like other flowers; see below
  üçâ
üçâ
```

The same logic applies to type methods.

### Access Level and Overriding

If you override a method and do not specify an access level, the method inherits
the overridden method‚Äôs access level. In the example below, üê°‚Äôs üôã method is üîê
because no access level was specified:

```
üêá üêü üçá
  üÜï üçáüçâ

  üîê ‚ùóÔ∏è üôã üçá
    üòÄ üî§I‚Äôm a fish.üî§‚ùóÔ∏è
  üçâ
üçâ

üêá üê° üêü üçá
  ‚úíÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è üôã üçá
    üòÄ üî§I‚Äôm a blowfish.üî§‚ùóÔ∏è
  üçâ
üçâ
```

An overriding method must be at least as acessible as the method it overrides.
This means that you cannot make an overriding method üîí, nor can you
override a üîì method with a üîê method.

## Calling Super Methods

Inside a method you can use this syntax to call the super method:

```syntax
$super$-> ‚§¥Ô∏è $emoji-id$ [$arguments$]
```

This simply calls the super method named *method-emoji* and returns it value.
You have already seen an example above.

## Promises

You must watch out not to break the superclass‚Äôs *promises* when overrding
methods. Promises are a set of rules that ensure that the methods and required
intializers of a class can be used the same way as the ones of the superclass ‚Äì
a main characteristic of object orientation. These promises are:

- The method or initializer of the subclass must take the same number of
  parameters.
- The return type of the method or initializer of the subclass must be the
  same or a subtype of the return type of the overriden method or intializer.
- The parameters of the method or initializer of the subclass must be of the same
  type or a super type of the argument types of the overriden method or
  intializer.
- The method or initializer of the subclass must have the same accessibility
  or be more accessible.
- If the super method or initializer is not escaping, the overriding method or
  initializer may not be escaping.
- If a parameter of the overriding method or initializer is escaping, so must
  be the respective parameter of the super method or initializer.
